### Current Files
```bash
# Your processed data is ready:
data/processed/train.txt        # 90,247 training samples
data/processed/val.txt          # 10,027 validation samples  
data/processed/tokenizer.json   # BPE tokenizer (1,783 vocab)
```

## 🚀 Ready to Train

Since your Wikipedia dataset is already prepared, you can immediately start training:

```bash
# Start GPU training (recommended)
python train_gpu_compatible.py

# Or CPU training for testing
python train_minimal.py
```

## 🔄 Alternative Wikipedia Options

If you want more Wikipedia data in the future:

### Option 1: Use Full Wikipedia
```bash
# Much larger dataset (500k+ samples)
python add_dataset.py wikipedia_full
```

### Option 2: Combine with Other Sources
```bash
# Add more educational content
python add_dataset.py --preset knowledge   # Wikipedia + Papers + Books
```

## 💡 Why Wikipedia Simple is Excellent

- **Broad Vocabulary**: Diverse topics = rich vocabulary

### Training Benefits
- **High-Quality Output**: Your model will generate factual, well-structured text
- **Diverse Knowledge**: Can discuss many topics intelligently
- **Good Grammar**: Learns proper English grammar and style
- **Reliable Content**: No spam, low-quality, or inappropriate content

### Perfect for Your GPU Setup
- **Right Size**: 90k samples ideal for RTX 5060 Ti development
- **Memory Efficient**: Fits well within 16GB VRAM constraints
- **Training Time**: Reasonable training duration (6-12 hours for good results)

## 📈 Expected Training Results

With your Wikipedia dataset, expect your L1 model to:
- ✅ **Generate factual content** about various topics
- ✅ **Use proper grammar** and sentence structure
- ✅ **Display broad knowledge** across multiple domains
- ✅ **Maintain consistent style** in generated text
- ✅ **Avoid hallucinations** common with lower-quality datasets

## 🔍 Monitoring Your Training

```bash
# Watch training progress
tail -f models/l1-gpu-compatible/training.log

# Check GPU utilization
nvidia-smi

# View model outputs during training
python generate_simple.py --prompt "Wikipedia is"
```

## � Dataset Management

### Check Current Status
```bash
# Verify your data is ready
ls -la data/processed/
# Should show: train.txt, val.txt, tokenizer.json

# View dataset statistics
python -c "
with open('data/processed/train.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    print(f'Training samples: {len(lines):,}')
    print('Sample text:', lines[0][:100] + '...')
    print('✅ Wikipedia dataset ready!')
"
```

### Start Training
```bash
# Begin or resume GPU training
python train_gpu_compatible.py

# Expected output:
# 🎓 Training Configuration:
#    ├── Dataset: Wikipedia Simple (90,247 samples)
#    ├── Vocabulary: 1,783 tokens
#    ├── Model: 155.8M parameters
#    ├── GPU: RTX 5060 Ti (16GB)
#    └── Checkpoints: Every 100 steps
```

### Generate Text
```bash
# Test your trained model
python generate_simple.py \
    --prompt "The history of artificial intelligence" \
    --model_path models/l1-gpu-compatible

# Expected quality: Educational, factual responses about AI history
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Training Fails to Start
```bash
# Check data files exist
ls data/processed/

# If missing, regenerate:
python prepare_large_dataset.py
```

### Memory Issues
```bash
# Reduce batch size in configs/train_config_gpu.yaml:
# batch_size: 4  # Instead of 8
```

### Generation Issues
```bash
# Check model checkpoint exists
ls models/l1-gpu-compatible/

# Use latest checkpoint
python generate_simple.py \
    --prompt "Test" \
    --model_path models/l1-gpu-compatible/latest_checkpoint.pt
```

## ✅ Summary

Your L1 is perfectly set up with Wikipedia Simple:
- ✅ **High-quality dataset** (90k+ educational samples)
- ✅ **Ready for training** (preprocessed and tokenized)  
- ✅ **Optimal size** (perfect for RTX 5060 Ti development)
- ✅ **Production-ready** (factual, well-structured content)
